**About--

The IoT Air Quality Monitoring System is a smart environmental sensing project designed to track and visualize real-time air quality data, specifically PM2.5 and CO2 levels. It uses internet-connected sensors to measure air pollutants and displays them on a user-friendly web dashboard. Project Objectives Measure air pollution using reliable sensors.

Monitor real-time and historical air quality.

Alert users of poor environmental conditions.

Provide a scalable solution for smart homes, schools, or cities. How It Works An ESP32 or ESP8266 microcontroller collects data from PM2.5 and CO2 sensors.

This data is sent over Wi-Fi to a cloud platform like Firebase or Blynk.

A web-based dashboard (built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Chart.js) displays the values and trends.

Users can monitor conditions remotely from any device with internet access. Technologies Used Hardware: ESP32 / ESP8266, PM2.5 sensor (e.g., PMS5003), CO2 sensor (e.g., MH-Z19B)

Software: Arduino IDE, Firebase/Blynk, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, Chart.js

Communication: Wi-Fi, MQTT or REST API (depending on the platform used) Applications Home automation systems

Smart city air quality stations

Educational environmental science projects

Health and workplace safety monitoring
